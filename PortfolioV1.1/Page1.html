            <p class="pageTXT">
                Our task was to take and exiting work of art, and make our own work by interpreting the art work we have chosen for this project. <br />
                We did this work in pairs, and me and my friend Omer Danin chose the work of Álexandre Louis Leloir, called massacare of the innocent.<br />
                The picture we chose depicts a terrible time when king something gave an order to kill all the first borns and we can see an image of a grown man with a sword holding the foot of a young child that his mother tries to protect him <br />
                We gave this work our own spin and went with that in the direction of our societies norms towards the meat industry, where the torture and the slaghter of helpless animals coralates with what happened in the work of Alexandre Louis Leloir.

                We worked in teams of two. Our first step was to find a piece of art to our liking, and then the hard work began.<br />
                We had to come up with a good way to make this work of art in our own vision and after alot of attempts we found a theme that we both like and agreed on.<br />
                First we took pictures on a camera and then we imbeded the steak with photoshop work.
